#Introduction
We are to make and IOS app that will connect with a rasberry pi so they can work together. The app will allow our client to enter in the degrees of rotation to send to the rasberry pi which will then in turn rotate a platform based on that input. After each degree of rotation it will take a photo and store it lcoally in a photo set. The client can then decide to send the photoset to the cloud and have it organized on conditions given to us by the client.
